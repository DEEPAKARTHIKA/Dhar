                        <strong>Hii AM</strong>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for that. I want to share a few things with you. First of all, you're the one who understands me the most. I've always thought of you as the most mature person in this class.

I won’t go into how things turned out the way they did, but I really regret what happened. During that time, many things happened, and I always wanted to share them with you but couldn’t.

I’m not sure what you think about me, but I’ve always believed you are special. I know you go through a lot, but please remember that you truly deserve the best. I really regret those 18 months when we didn’t speak. Without a doubt, you are the best thing that happened to me in college. I missed you ..... AM Bye for now!
                        </p>
